# 🌍 Travel-Agency
I built this Travel Agency Website as a practice project to explore responsive design, carousels, and multi‑page site structure with a consistent theme. This project helped me learn how to design, structure, and style a complete multi‑page website using just HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

A complete **Travel Agency multi‑page website** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
The project has a **green gradient theme** inspired by travel and eco‑exploration, featuring a modern hero section with background overlay, responsive carousel, booking system, and multiple pages for destinations, packages, and contact.
