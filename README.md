# Travel-Agency
I built this Travel Agency Website as a practice project to explore responsive design, carousels, and multi‑page site structure with a consistent theme. This project helped me learn how to design, structure, and style a complete multi‑page website using just HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
